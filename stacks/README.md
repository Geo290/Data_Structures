_What is Stack Data Structure?_

A stack is a linear data structure that follows 
the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It behaves 
like a stack of plates, where the last plate added 
is the first one to be removed.

_Basic Operations of Stack Data Structures_

-> Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
-> Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
-> Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
-> IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
-> getSize
