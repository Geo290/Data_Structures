# What is Queue in Data Structures?

A queue is a linear data structure that follows 
the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates 
like a line where elements are added at one end (rear) 
and removed from the other end (front).

## Applications of Queue

-> Task scheduling in operating systems
-> Data transfer in network communication
-> Simulation of real-world systems (e.g., waiting lines)

## Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure_

- [x] constructor
- [x] enqueue
- [x] dequeue
- [x] getSize
- [x] isEmpty
- [x] peek
- [x] print
